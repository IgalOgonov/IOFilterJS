 Instructions:

   - Has to be included after jQuery 3+

   - Include IOFilterJS.js and IOFilterJS.css .
     If you somehow downloaded this without IOFilterJS.css, read on and you can create it easily on your own.

   - Read docs in the JS file itself (on top) to understand how to structure buttons/elements. The example helps!
